## 📋 Requirements

```text
Python 3.8+
See requirements.txt for full dependencies
```

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/degun-osint/RhinoUserChecker
cd RhinoUserChecker
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

RPUC uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` based on .env-sample file in the root directory with:

```env
WMN_JSON_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebBreacher/WhatsMyName/main/wmn-data.json
PROXY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/proxy
```
By default, the script uses a forked version of WMN JSON.

## 🐳 Docker Installation

### Using Docker Compose (recommended)

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/degun-osint/RhinoUserChecker
cd RhinoUserChecker
```

2. Run the application:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Attach to the running container to interact with the application:
```bash
docker attach rhino-user-checker
```

4. To exit the application, press `Ctrl+C` and then to detach from the container without stopping it, press `Ctrl+P` followed by `Ctrl+Q`

### Using Docker directly

1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t rhino-user-checker .
```

2. Run the container:
```bash
docker run -it --name rhino-user-checker -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data -v $(pwd)/results:/app/results rhino-user-checker
```

The application creates two directories:
- `./data`: Stores the WhatsMyName database
- `./results`: Stores exported results (HTML and CSV)

These directories are mounted as volumes to persist data between container runs.

### Docker Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with Docker:
2. Check that the volumes have the correct permissions
3. If you're having network issues, ensure your Docker container has internet access

## 🎮 Usage

Start the tool by running:

```bash
python run.py
```

The tool will:
1. Download the latest site data from WhatsMyName project
2. Prompt you for a username to search
3. Search across hundreds of platforms
4. Generate an HTML or a CSV report with findings

## 📊 Output

RPUC generates two types of output:
- Real-time console output with progress tracking
- Detailed HTML or CSV report containing:
  - Found profiles with links
  - Status (found = good chance profile exists, unsure = good http [200] code when a 404 was expected if profile does not exists, but can't confirm the profile)
  - Extracted profile information
  - Discovered external links
  - Metadata from profiles

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Custom Headers

RPUC supports custom headers for different domains/regions. Edit the `DOMAIN_PATTERNS` in `proxy.py` to add more patterns.

### Proxy Configuration

By default, RPUC runs its own proxy server for rate limiting. You can configure an external proxy by modifying the `PROXY_URL` in your `.env` file.
